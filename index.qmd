## Introduction

### Support Vector Machines.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning
algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The
main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates
the different classes in the training data. This is done by finding the
hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance
between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. Once
the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining
on which side of the hyperplane it falls. SVMs are particularly useful
when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of
separation in the data.

Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points.
Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed
to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon
the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the
hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then
the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to
imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.

### **Mathematical Intuition of Support Vector Machine**

Consider a binary classification task where there are two classes,
denoted by the labels +1 and -1. The input feature vectors (X) and the
matching class labels (Y) comprise our training dataset.

Equation for hyperplane can be written as:

$w^Tx+b=0$

The vector W represents the normal vector to the hyperplane. i.e the
direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. The parameter **b** in the
equation represents the offset or distance of the hyperplane from the
origin along the normal vector **w**.

$d_i = \frac{w^Tx_i + b}{\|w\|}$

where \|\|w\|\| represents the Euclidean norm of the weight vector w.
Euclidean norm of the normal vector W

$\hat{y} =\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } w^T x + b \geq 0 \\ 1 & \text{if } w^T x + b < 0 \end{cases}$

### kernel function in SVM

SVM kernel is a function that takes low-dimensional input space and
transforms it into higher-dimensional space, ie it converts nonseparable
problems to separable problems. It is mostly useful in non-linear
separation problems. Simply put the kernel, does some extremely complex
data transformations and then finds out the process to separate the data
based on the labels or outputs defined.

$Linear : K(w,b)=w^Tx+b$

**Using SVM with Financial Statement Analysis for Prediction of Stocks**

The paper introduces a method for stock market prediction using Support
Vector Machines (SVM) combined with financial statement analysis. Unlike
technical indices, financial indices are considered more reliable and
valid. The researchers applied SVM with a Gaussian radial basis function
(RBF) kernel to construct a prediction model. The study utilized
financial statements from stock companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges, with 251 brand-new and dependable datasets. The primary
indices for analysis included Earnings Per Share (EPS), Book Value Per
Share (BVPS), and Net Profit Growth Rate (NPGR). The Outstanding
Achievement Growth Rate (OAGR) was classified into two choices, +1 and
-1, denoted as SVM. Eight prediction modules were generated by combining
SVM with the three primary indices. The paper aims to compare
experimental results from these modules, with the first module serving
as the basic one. The comparison allows different stockholders to select
relevant items for analysis based on their specific needs, as the first
module primarily reflects the accuracy rate of professionals and experts
rather than addressing stockholders' analyses.

**Sentiment Analysis Online Shop On The Play Store Using Method Support
Vector Machine (SVM)**

**Multilevel Weighted Support Vector Machine for Classification on
Healthcare Data with Missing Values**

The paper addresses the challenges in predictive analytics on healthcare
data, specifically Electronic Medical Records, which often suffer from
noise, missing entries, and imbalances in class distribution, leading to
biased predictive models. Standard data mining methods are deemed
inadequate, prompting the proposal of specialized techniques for data
preprocessing and classification. The authors introduce a novel approach
that simultaneously classifies large datasets and mitigates the impact
of missing values. This method employs a multilevel framework involving
cost-sensitive Support Vector Machines (SVM) and expected maximization
imputation for missing values through iterated regression analyses.
Comparative evaluations on benchmark datasets and real healthcare data

and low-quality DNA chromatograms. The study introduces a novel quality
evaluation technique, treating the problem as a two-class classification
issue, where SVM is chosen as the classifier. The SVM is trained on a
set of features extracted from chromatograms, and the resulting
hyperplane is then applied to a testing set, generating a confusion
matrix. The results indicate high accuracy, with only one mistake,
making the proposed method a promising solution for automating the
screening of DNA data, particularly in large DNA sequencing facilities.

homes**

The paper introduces incremental SVM methods that improve the
classification performance of SVM in the context of smart home human
activity detection. Two characteristic extraction techniques are
proposed: refining dependent sensor extraction and focusing on the last
sensor event. Additional SVM methods include a cluster-based approach
(IncSucc) to remove redundant information from new pieces and a
similarity-based approach to identify and reject support vectors and new
strong similarities. Simulations on Aruba and Tulum datasets show the
feasibility and improvement of the proposed methods in real-time
learning and classification, and similarity-based incremental learning
is significantly faster. This approach also addresses the challenge of
reducing data and support vectors incrementally for efficient model
development.

**A credit risk assessment model based on SVM for small and medium
enterprises in supply chain finance**

Supply Chain Finance (SCF) is the field in which financial services
providers assist customers and suppliers in managing their working
capital. Leading supply chain companies in this system ensure financing
for Small and Medium Businesses (SMEs). This study suggests an index
method that takes into account the credit standing of major corporations
and their links with small and medium-sized firms in order to evaluate
credit risks in SCF. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and BP Neural
Network-based credit risk models are contrasted. More accurate
assessments of SME credit risk by banks and the possibility of loosening
lending limitations on SMEs are made possible by the higher efficiency
of the SVM model. In general, the SVM model and the SCF credit risk
assessment index system provide banks with the best possible combination
for assessing the credit risk of SMEs.

kernel approach. In an era where information is extremely valuable, the
healthcare industry produces a lot of data that includes patient
information and disease-related data. By analyzing this vast amount of
medical data, the suggested generic architecture aims to reveal
underlying illness patterns and enable personalized treatment.
Particularly, a fewer number of attributes from datasets on diabetes,
heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were tested in this study. The
enhanced SVM-Radial bias kernel method outperformed other machine
learning approaches in R studio, including SVM-Linear, SVM-Polynomial,
Random Forest, and Decision Tree. Notably, for the datasets on chronic
kidney disease, diabetes, and heart disease, respectively, this approach
showed astounding accuracy rates of 98.3%, 98.7%, and 89.9%. The results
mentioned above highlight the effectiveness of support vector machines
(SVM) in personalized healthcare and disease prediction.

Monitoring Services**

The paper discusses the challenges in medical services costs due to the
increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and aging populations. It
explores the use of artificial intelligence and wearable devices in
health monitoring services provided by medical institutions, often
employing support vector machine (SVM) classification techniques for
real-time medical decisions. The introduction of cloud-based health
monitoring services raises privacy concerns, particularly regarding
potential malicious behavior by the cloud server. The proposed solution,
VSSVMC, presents a verifiable and secure SVM classification scheme
tailored for cloud-based health monitoring services under a malicious
threat model. It ensures decision verifiability and data confidentiality
through the integration of pseudorandom permutations, pseudorandom
functions, and symmetric key encryption, addressing a more robust threat
model compared to existing schemes. The article provides formal proofs
for the security, verifiability, and efficiency of VSSVMC, demonstrating
competitive performance in computation, communication, and storage costs
through experimental evaluations on the Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin dataset.
Notably, VSSVMC achieves O(1) computational complexity, microsecond
execution time, and minimal communication and storage costs, positioning
it as a promising solution for trustworthy and privacy-preserving
cloud-based health monitoring services.

**Efficient Medical Diagnosis of Human Heart Diseases Using Machine
Learning Techniques With and Without GridSearchCV**

This research aims to develop an intuitive medical prediction system for
early detection of heart disease using modern machine learning
techniques. Various classifier algorithms, including logistic
regression, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, and Gradient
Boosting Classifier with and without GridSearchCV, were trained and
compared for optimal heart disease detection. Four model selection
strategies, including correlation-based feature subset evaluator and
Gradient Boosting Classifier with GridSearchCV, were employed to
identify attributes influencing classifier performance. The Extreme
Gradient Boosting Classifier with GridSearchCV exhibited the highest
accuracy (100% and 99.03%) across different datasets. The study

SVM method**

The study focuses on selecting online marketplaces based on reviews and
comments to address user hesitancy. Researchers collect and process
comments from online marketplaces, creating datasets for analysis. Using
the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the text data is classified,
and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed for comparison. While
SVM alone provides good results, the combination with PSO optimization
enhances accuracy, particularly in text classification for marketplace
reviews. The testing results reveal insights for sellers to identify
sentiment-related words with significant weight in customer feedback.

**Prediction of Consumer Purchasing in a Grocery Store Using Machine
Learning Techniques**

This study focuses on customer predictions and purchase behavior, which
has been the subject of consumer behavior research in recent decades.
While traditional models relied on simple equations to understand
purchase intent that take into account factors such as age, gender,
income and advertising intent, the use of technology such as point of
sale systems and sensors yielded vast amounts of data. Linear models
often used in this context, such as linear discriminant analysis and
logistic regression, are currently considered insufficient to meet the
growing demands of academia and practitioners. In response, this paper
examines the effectiveness of two advanced machine learning methods, the
Bayesian classifier and the support vector machine (SVM), using real
data to predict purchasing behavior.

**Support Vector Machines for Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus**

The suggested method makes use of support vector machines to diagnose
diabetes, improving their interpretability by adding a module for more
explanation. This module converts the classification choices made by the
SVM from a "black box" model to a comprehensible representation. The
interpretable rulesets produced by the understandable SVMs add to the
diagnostic process's interpretability. Based on a real-world diabetes
dataset, interpretable support vector machines (SVMs) show encouraging
results, with 94% prediction accuracy, 93% sensitivity, and 94%
specificity. The extracted guidelines are consistent with pertinent
research and medical expertise.

**Applying Support Vector Machine to Electronic Health Records for
Cancer Classification**

To classify cancer cases, the study uses a support vector machine (SVM)
model that was trained on medical data taken from electronic health
records (EHRs). A prediction accuracy of 86.2% was achieved for 10
distinct types of malignancies using the training process, which used
100 pieces of medical records per malignancy. Additionally, when trained
with 400 pieces of medical records per cancer, the accuracy rises to
97.33% for three distinct types of malignancies.

**An effective intrusion detection approach using SVM with naïve Bayes
feature embedding**

This paper focuses on network security and intrusion detection systems,
highlighting the significance of data quality in constructing an
effective system. The authors propose a framework that combines Support
Vector Machines (SVM) with naïve Bayes feature embedding for intrusion
detection. The naïve Bayes feature transformation technique is applied
to the original features, generating high-quality data, which is then
used to train an SVM classifier for building the intrusion detection
model.The experiments conducted on multiple datasets in the intrusion
detection domain demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
It achieves impressive and robust performances with high accuracy rates:
93.75% on UNSW-NB15, 98.92% on CICIDS2017, 99.35% on NSL-KDD, and 98.58%
on Kyoto 2006+.

**New hybrid method for attack detection using combination of
evolutionary algorithms, SVM, and ANN**

This paper focuses on enhancing intrusion detection systems (IDS) for
computer networks by proposing a new hybrid method. The method consists
of two phases: a feature selection phase and an attack detection phase.
In the feature selection phase, a wrapper technique called MGA-SVM,
which combines support vector machine (SVM) features with the genetic
algorithm using multi-parent crossover and multi-parent mutation (MGA),
is employed. The attack detection phase utilizes an artificial neural
network (ANN), and to improve its performance, a combination of hybrid
gravitational search (HGS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used
to train the classifier. The overall hybrid method is named
MGA-SVM-HGS-PSO-ANN.The performance of this method is compared with
other popular techniques such as Chi-SVM, ANN based on gradient descent
(GD-ANN), decision tree (DT), ANN based on genetic algorithm (GA-ANN),
GSPSO-ANN, PSO-ANN, and GS-ANN. The evaluation is conducted using the
NSL-KDD dataset as a standard benchmark for attack detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed MGA-SVM-HGS-PSO-ANN method
achieves a maximum detection accuracy of 99.3%, reduces the
dimensionality of NSL-KDD from 42 to 4 features, and requires only 3
seconds as the maximum training time.
