## Introduction

### Support Vector Machines.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning
algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The
main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates
the different classes in the training data. This is done by finding the
hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance
between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. Once
the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining
on which side of the hyperplane it falls. SVMs are particularly useful
when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of
separation in the data (A, L., 2020).

Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points.
Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed
to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon
the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the
hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then
the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to
imagine when the number of features exceeds 3 (Gandhi, R., 2018).

### **Mathematical Intuition of Support Vector Machine**

Consider a binary classification task where there are two classes,
denoted by the labels +1 and -1. The input feature vectors (X) and the
matching class labels (Y) comprise our training dataset.

Equation for hyperplane can be written as:

$w^Tx+b=0$

The vector W represents the normal vector to the hyperplane. i.e the
direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. The parameter **b** in the
equation represents the offset or distance of the hyperplane from the
origin along the normal vector **w**.

$d_i = \frac{w^Tx_i + b}{\|w\|}$

where \|\|w\|\| represents the Euclidean norm of the weight vector w.
Euclidean norm of the normal vector W

$\hat{y} =\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } w^T x + b \geq 0 \\ 1 & \text{if } w^T x + b < 0 \end{cases}$

### kernel function in SVM

SVM kernel is a function that takes low-dimensional input space and
transforms it into higher-dimensional space, ie it converts nonseparable
problems to separable problems. It is mostly useful in non-linear
separation problems. Simply put the kernel, does some extremely complex
data transformations and then finds out the process to separate the data
based on the labels or outputs defined (Sasidharan, A., 2021).

$Linear : K(w,b)=w^Tx+b$

## Literature Review

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have emerged as a potent tool in the realm
of supervised learning, offering a robust mathematical framework for
both classification and regression tasks. With a foundation rooted in
principles such as structural risk minimization and kernel functions
(Jakkula, 2006), SVM has demonstrated exceptional generalization
capabilities, adeptly handling non-linear decision boundaries through
kernel tricks (Jun, 2021; Deris, 2011). Despite challenges like
computational cost and scalability (Bhavsar, 2012), the evolution of SVM
has led to significant contributions in diverse fields, including
pattern recognition, computer vision (Kecman, 2005), and even
agriculture, where it aids in optimizing crop yield and disease
identification (Kumar et al., 2017). The ongoing advancements in SVM
research are geared towards refining algorithms and broadening their
application spectrum, especially in the context of burgeoning data
volumes (Yue, 2003).

In the financial and healthcare sectors, SVM has proven its efficacy in
various applications. It has been utilized to construct reliable stock
market prediction models by analyzing financial indices like Earnings
Per Share (EPS) and Net Profit Growth Rate (NPGR) (Han, 2007). In
healthcare, SVM has been instrumental in developing advanced diagnostic
tools, such as the optimized SVM model for early dementia prediction
(Javeed et al., 2023) and the multi-disease prediction model using an
improved SVM-radial bias kernel approach (Harimoorthy & Thangavelu,
2021). These innovations underscore the potential of machine learning in
revolutionizing healthcare by facilitating early diagnosis and
personalized treatment plans.

SVM's application extends to domains like online retail and network
security, where it addresses complex challenges with remarkable
efficiency. In online marketplaces, SVM combined with Particle Swarm
Optimization has enhanced the accuracy of text classification for
customer reviews (Sahara et al., 2023), providing valuable insights for
sellers. In the realm of network security, innovative approaches such as
combining SVM with naïve Bayes feature embedding have been proposed for
intrusion detection, achieving high accuracy rates in identifying
network threats (Computers & Security, 2021). Moreover, the development
of hybrid methods for attack detection, which integrate SVM features
with evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks, has shown
significant promise in reducing dimensionality and training time while
maintaining high detection accuracy (Computer Networks, 2020).

Machine learning techniques, particularly SVM, are revolutionizing
various fields by addressing complex challenges with precision and
efficiency. In healthcare, SVM has been applied to electronic health
records for cancer classification, achieving high accuracy rates in
identifying different types of malignancies (IEEE Xplore, 2021).
Furthermore, SVM's versatility is evident in its application across
domains such as finance, where it has been used to assess credit risk
for small and medium enterprises in supply chain finance (Zhang, Hu, &
Zhang, 2015), and in cloud-based services, where it ensures data
confidentiality and decision verifiability in health monitoring systems
(Liang et al., 2021). These advancements highlight the transformative
potential of machine learning techniques in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy, optimizing financial assessments, and ensuring secure
cloud-based services.
