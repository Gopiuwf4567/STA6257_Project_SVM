## Introduction

### Support Vector Machines.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning
algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The
main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates
the different classes in the training data. This is done by finding the
hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance
between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. Once
the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining
on which side of the hyperplane it falls. SVMs are particularly useful
when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of
separation in the data.

Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points.
Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed
to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon
the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the
hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then
the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to
imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.

### SVM A Comprehensive Synthesis of Current Research and Future Directions.

1.  **Early Prediction of Dementia Using Feature Extraction Battery(FEB)
    and Optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Classification**

    The research focuses on early dementia prediction using machine
    learning (ML), specifically the optimized support vector machine
    (SVM) FEB-SVM model. The study addresses the limitations of existing
    ML models by adding Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) bias and
    introduces new feature extraction (FEB) techniques to improve
    accuracy. The data is collected from the Swedish National Survey on
    Aging and Care (SNAC), and the accuracy of the proposed FEB-SVM
    model is 6% better than the traditional SVM. The model is trained on
    a dataset of 726 participants, showing 98.28% training accuracy and
    93.92% testing accuracy. The study outperforms 12 state-of-the-art
    ML models in predicting dementia, demonstrating its effectiveness in
    early diagnosis. The methodology includes data processing, feature
    extraction using LDA, ICA, PCA, LLE, and t-SNE, unbalanced class
    treatment using ADASYN, and SVM hyperparameter optimization using
    grid search.

2.  **New incremental SVM algorithms for human activity recognition in
    smart homes**

    The paper introduces incremental SVM methods that improve the
    classification performance of SVM in the context of smart home human
    activity detection. Two characteristic extraction techniques are
    proposed: refining dependent sensor extraction and focusing on the
    last sensor event. Additional SVM methods include a cluster-based
    approach (IncSucc) to remove redundant information from new pieces
    and a similarity-based approach to identify and reject support
    vectors and new strong similarities. Simulations on Aruba and Tulum
    datasets show the feasibility and improvement of the proposed
    methods in real-time learning and classification, and
    similarity-based incremental learning is significantly faster. This
    approach also addresses the challenge of reducing data and support
    vectors incrementally for efficient model development.

3.  **A credit risk assessment model based on SVM for small and medium
    enterprises in supply chain finance**

    Supply Chain Finance (SCF) is the field in which financial services
    providers assist customers and suppliers in managing their working
    capital. Leading supply chain companies in this system ensure
    financing for Small and Medium Businesses (SMEs). This study
    suggests an index method that takes into account the credit standing
    of major corporations and their links with small and medium-sized
    firms in order to evaluate credit risks in SCF. Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) and BP Neural Network-based credit risk models are
    contrasted. More accurate assessments of SME credit risk by banks
    and the possibility of loosening lending limitations on SMEs are
    made possible by the higher efficiency of the SVM model. In general,
    the SVM model and the SCF credit risk assessment index system
    provide banks with the best possible combination for assessing the
    credit risk of SMEs.

4.  **Multi-disease prediction model using improved SVM-radial bias
    technique in healthcare monitoring system**

    This work focuses on using machine learning to predict diseases in
    the healthcare sector, specifically using the enhanced SVM-Radial
    bias kernel approach. In an era where information is extremely
    valuable, the healthcare industry produces a lot of data that
    includes patient information and disease-related data. By analyzing
    this vast amount of medical data, the suggested generic architecture
    aims to reveal underlying illness patterns and enable personalized
    treatment. Particularly, a fewer number of attributes from datasets
    on diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease were tested
    in this study. The enhanced SVM-Radial bias kernel method
    outperformed other machine learning approaches in R studio,
    including SVM-Linear, SVM-Polynomial, Random Forest, and Decision
    Tree. Notably, for the datasets on chronic kidney disease, diabetes,
    and heart disease, respectively, this approach showed astounding
    accuracy rates of 98.3%, 98.7%, and 89.9%. The results mentioned
    above highlight the effectiveness of support vector machines (SVM)
    in personalized healthcare and disease prediction.
