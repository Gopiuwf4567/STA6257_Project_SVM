## Introduction

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning
algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. The
main idea behind SVMs is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates
the different classes in the training data. This is done by finding the
hyperplane that has the largest margin, which is defined as the distance
between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. Once
the hyperplane is determined, new data can be classified by determining
on which side of the hyperplane it falls. SVMs are particularly useful
when the data has many features, and/or when there is a clear margin of
separation in the data.

Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points.
Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed
to different classes. Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon
the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the
hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then
the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to
imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.

## Literature Review

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have emerged as a potent tool in the realm
of supervised learning, offering a robust mathematical framework for
both classification and regression tasks. With a foundation rooted in
principles such as structural risk minimization and kernel functions
(Jakkula, 2006), SVM has demonstrated exceptional generalization
capabilities, adeptly handling non-linear decision boundaries through
kernel tricks (Jun, 2021; Deris, 2011). Despite challenges like
computational cost and scalability (Bhavsar, 2012), the evolution of SVM
has led to significant contributions in diverse fields, including
pattern recognition, computer vision (Kecman, 2005), and even
agriculture, where it aids in optimizing crop yield and disease
identification (Kumar et al., 2017). The ongoing advancements in SVM
research are geared towards refining algorithms and broadening their
application spectrum, especially in the context of burgeoning data
volumes (Yue, 2003).

In the financial and healthcare sectors, SVM has proven its efficacy in
various applications. It has been utilized to construct reliable stock
market prediction models by analyzing financial indices like Earnings
Per Share (EPS) and Net Profit Growth Rate (NPGR) (Han, 2007). In
healthcare, SVM has been instrumental in developing advanced diagnostic
tools, such as the optimized SVM model for early dementia prediction
(Javeed et al., 2023) and the multi-disease prediction model using an
improved SVM-radial bias kernel approach (Harimoorthy & Thangavelu,
2021). These innovations underscore the potential of machine learning in
revolutionizing healthcare by facilitating early diagnosis and
personalized treatment plans.

SVM's application extends to domains like online retail and network
security, where it addresses complex challenges with remarkable
efficiency. In online marketplaces, SVM combined with Particle Swarm
Optimization has enhanced the accuracy of text classification for
customer reviews (Sahara et al., 2023), providing valuable insights for
sellers. In the realm of network security, innovative approaches such as
combining SVM with na√Øve Bayes feature embedding have been proposed for
intrusion detection, achieving high accuracy rates in identifying
network threats (Computers & Security, 2021). Moreover, the development
of hybrid methods for attack detection, which integrate SVM features
with evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks, has shown
significant promise in reducing dimensionality and training time while
maintaining high detection accuracy (Computer Networks, 2020).

Machine learning techniques, particularly SVM, are revolutionizing
various fields by addressing complex challenges with precision and
efficiency. In healthcare, SVM has been applied to electronic health
records for cancer classification, achieving high accuracy rates in
identifying different types of malignancies (IEEE Xplore, 2021).
Furthermore, SVM's versatility is evident in its application across
domains such as finance, where it has been used to assess credit risk
for small and medium enterprises in supply chain finance (Zhang, Hu, &
Zhang, 2015), and in cloud-based services, where it ensures data
confidentiality and decision verifiability in health monitoring systems
(Liang et al., 2021). These advancements highlight the transformative
potential of machine learning techniques in enhancing diagnostic
accuracy, optimizing financial assessments, and ensuring secure
cloud-based services.

## Dataset

Customer retention is a critical aspect for banks to ensure the
sustainability of their operations. ABC Multinational Bank, in
particular, places a strong emphasis on retaining its account holders.
The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the customer data
of the bank's account holders to predict and prevent customer churn
effectively.

The dataset under consideration contains information about account
holders at ABC Multinational Bank, with the ultimate goal of predicting
customer churn. The dataset comprises the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description                                                                        |

### Methodology

**Mathematical Intuition of Support Vector Machine**

Consider a binary classification task where there are two classes,
denoted by the labels +1 and -1. The input feature vectors (X) and the
matching class labels (Y) comprise our training dataset.

Equation for hyperplane can be written as:

$w^Tx+b=0$

The vector W represents the normal vector to the hyperplane. i.e the
direction perpendicular to the hyperplane. The parameter **b** in the
equation represents the offset or distance of the hyperplane from the
origin along the normal vector **w**.

$d_i = \frac{w^Tx_i + b}{\|w\|}$

where \|\|w\|\| represents the Euclidean norm of the weight vector w.
Euclidean norm of the normal vector W

$\hat{y} =\begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } w^T x + b \geq 0 \\ 1 & \text{if } w^T x + b < 0 \end{cases}$

**kernel function in SVM**

SVM kernel is a function that takes low-dimensional input space and
transforms it into higher-dimensional space, ie it converts nonseparable
problems to separable problems. It is mostly useful in non-linear
separation problems. Simply put the kernel, does some extremely complex
data transformations and then finds out the process to separate the data
based on the labels or outputs defined.

$Linear : K(w,b)=w^Tx+b$

### Data Analysis

**Loading Libraries**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
#install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
```

**Load Data**

```{r}
df <- read.csv("dataset/train.csv")
```

```{r}
head(df)
```

**Summary Statistics**

```{r}
summary(select(df, CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, EstimatedSalary))
```

**Credit Score:**

-   The Credit Score ranges from a minimum of 350 to a maximum of 850.

-   The median Credit Score is 659, indicating that half of the
    customers have a score below 659 and half have a score above.

-   The mean Credit Score is approximately 656.5, suggesting that the
    average creditworthiness of customers is in the mid-range.

-   The 1st quartile (25th percentile) is 597, and the 3rd quartile
    (75th percentile) is 710, indicating that 50% of customers have a
    Credit Score between 597 and 710.

**Age:**

-   The Age of customers ranges from 18 to 92 years. The median age is
    37 years, meaning half of the customers are younger than 37 and half
    are older.

-   The mean age is approximately 38.13 years, indicating that the
    average customer is in their late thirties.

-   The distribution of Age is slightly right-skewed, as the mean is
    slightly higher than the median.

**Tenure:**

-   Tenure, or the number of years customers have been with the bank,
    ranges from 0 to 10 years.

-   The median tenure is 5 years, indicating that half of the customers
    have been with the bank for less than 5 years and half for more.

-   The mean tenure is approximately 5.02 years, suggesting that the
    average customer has been with the bank for around 5 years.

**Balance:**

-   The account Balance ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of
    250,898.

-   The median balance is 0, indicating that at least half of the
    customers have no balance in their account.

-   The mean balance is approximately 55,478, suggesting that while many
    customers have low or zero balances, some have significant amounts
    in their accounts.

**Number of Products:**

-   The Number of Products customers have with the bank ranges from 1 to

    4.  

-   The median number of products is 2, meaning that half of the
    customers have 2 or fewer products with the bank.

-   The mean number of products is approximately 1.554, indicating that
    on average, customers have between 1 and 2 products with the bank.

**Estimated Salary:**

-   The Estimated Salary ranges from a minimum of 11.58 to a maximum of
    199,992.48.

-   The median estimated salary is 117,948, suggesting that half of the
    customers have an estimated salary below this amount and half above.

-   The mean estimated salary is approximately 112,574.82, indicating
    that the average estimated salary of customers is around 112k.

**Count Of Categorical value types**

```{r}
sapply(df[,c('Geography', 'Gender', 'HasCrCard', 'IsActiveMember', 'Exited')], function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

**Checking null values**

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```

There are no null values in the data.

**Distribution of target variable**

```{r}
table(df$Exited)
```

We can see number of customers exited are more compared to number of
customers not exited. So there is a quite imbalance in data which needs
to be addressed while building the model.

**Distribution of target variable across Geography.**

```{r}

table(df$Geography, df$Exited)

```

**France:**

-   A total of 94,215 customers are from France.
-   Out of these, 78,643 customers have not exited the bank (retained),
-   while 15,572 customers have exited (churned).
-   The churn rate for France is approximately 16.53%.

**Germany:**

-   A total of 34,606 customers are from Germany.
-   Out of these, 21,492 customers have not exited the bank, while
    13,114 customers have exited.
-   The churn rate for Germany is approximately 37.89%.

**Spain:**

-   A total of 36,213 customers are from Spain.
-   Out of these, 29,978 customers have not exited the bank, while 6,235
    customers have exited.
-   The churn rate for Spain is approximately 17.21%.

**Which Gender has highest Credit Score?**

```{r}
aggregate(df$CreditScore, by = list(df$Gender), FUN = mean)
```

**Observations:**

-   The difference in average credit scores between male and female
    customers is minimal, indicating that gender does not significantly
    impact creditworthiness in this dataset.

-   Both genders have an average credit score in the mid-650s, which is
    considered a fair credit score range.

**Distribution of Age.**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black")
```

**Observations:**

-   The largest concentration of customers falls within the 30 to
    40-year-old range, indicating that the majority of customers are in
    their early to mid-career stages.

-   There is a significant drop in frequency as age increases,
    especially beyond 50 years. This suggests that the customer base
    skews younger.

-   The distribution is right-skewed, meaning there are fewer older
    customers (those over 60) compared to younger customers.

-   There is a small number of customers in the youngest age bracket
    (under 25 years) and the oldest (over 75 years).

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = EstimatedSalary)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black")
```

**Observations:**

-   The distribution is quite uniform across different salary ranges,
    with no distinct peaks that would indicate a concentration of
    individuals around a specific salary bracket.

-   There are frequent spikes throughout the distribution, which may
    suggest that the data contains many unique values with small
    frequencies. This could be indicative of precise salary estimations
    rather than rounded figures.

-   The salaries range from very low values close to 0 up to 200,000,
    indicating a diverse group from potentially different economic
    backgrounds or job roles.

-   There is no obvious concentration of data points around the lower,
    middle, or upper salary range, which is unusual for income data
    where one typically expects to see more of a bell-shaped
    distribution centered around a median salary range.

**Comparing the distribution of account balances between customers who
have exited and customer who have not exited.**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Exited), y = Balance)) + geom_boxplot()
```

**Observations:**

-   **Balance Distribution:**

    -   The y-axis represents the balance on customer accounts, which
        seems to range from 0 to a bit over 250,000.

    -   Both boxes have a similar interquartile range (IQR), which is
        the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the
        third quartile (75th percentile), represented by the height of
        the boxes. This suggests that the middle 50% of balances are
        similarly distributed between both groups.

    -   The median, indicated by the line within each box, is roughly at
        the same level for both groups, suggesting that the central
        tendency of balance is similar regardless of whether the
        customer has exited or not.

-   **Outliers:**

    -   There are visible outliers for both groups, indicated by the
        points beyond the whiskers of the box plot. These outliers
        represent customers with balances significantly higher than the
        general population of the dataset.

**How the distribution of the number of products varies across different
geographical regions?**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Geography, fill = as.factor(NumOfProducts))) + geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

**Observations:**

1.  **France:**

    -   France has the highest count of customers using one product,
        followed closely by those using two products. The number of
        customers using three and four products is significantly lower.

2.  **Germany:**

    -   Germany shows a similar pattern to France with one and two
        products being the most common among customers. However, the
        count for one product is notably lower than in France, whereas
        the count for two products is slightly higher.

3.  **Spain:**

    -   Spain's pattern mirrors that of France and Germany, with one
        product being the most common, followed by two products. Again,
        three and four products are used by a considerably smaller
        number of customers.

**Pairplot of Age vs Estimated Salary and also checking which age group
and salary range have exited the bank.**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age, y = EstimatedSalary, color = as.factor(Exited))) + geom_point()
```

**Observations:**

1.  There doesn't appear to be a clear pattern or correlation between
    Age and Estimated Salary with customer churn, as the exited and
    non-exited customers are interspersed throughout the plot without
    any distinct clustering.

2.  Customers who have exited are spread across all ages and salary
    levels, but there seems to be a slightly higher concentration of
    churned customers in the 40 to 50 age range.

**Pairplot of Age vs Credit Score and also checking which age group and
Credit Score range have exited the bank.**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Age, y = CreditScore , color = as.factor(Exited))) + geom_point()
```

**Observations:**

1.  There is a wide distribution of Credit Scores across different ages
    with no clear pattern indicating that Credit Score by itself may not
    be a strong predictor of customer exit.

2.  Both exited and non-exited customers are found across the entire
    range of Credit Scores and Age, but there is a noticeable density of
    exited customers (blue dots) in the middle age range, particularly
    between ages 40 and 50.

**Pairplot of EstimatedSalary vs Credit Score and also checking what
Estimated Salary range and Credit Score range have exited the bank.**

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = EstimatedSalary, y = CreditScore , color = as.factor(Exited))) + geom_point()
```

**Observations:**

The scatter plot shows no clear correlation between Credit Score and
Estimated Salary in predicting customer churn, with both customers who
exited and those who did not evenly dispersed across all ranges of
Salary and Credit Scores.

**Correlation Plot**

```{r}
corr_matrix <- cor(select(df, CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, EstimatedSalary))
corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "circle")
```

**Observations:**

There seems to be a noticeable positive correlation between Age and
Balance, and a negative correlation between NumOfProducts and Balance.
